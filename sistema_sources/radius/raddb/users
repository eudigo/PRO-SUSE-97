#	This file contains security and configuration information for
#	each user.  The first field is the user's name and can be up to
#	8 characters in length.  This is followed (on the same line)
#	with the list of authentication requirements for that user.
#	This can include password, comm server name, comm server port
#	number, and an expiration date of the user's password.  When an
#	authentication request is received from the comm server, these
#	values are tested.  Special users named "DEFAULT", "DEFAULT2",
#	"DEFAULT3" can be created (and should be placed at the end of
#	the user file) to specify what to do with users not contained
#	in the user file.
#
#	Indented (with the tab character) lines following the first
#	line indicate the configuration values to be passed back to
#	the comm server to allow the initiation of a user session.
#	This can include things like the PPP configuration values
#	or the host to log the user onto.
#
#	Delete or comment out these examples before using this file!
