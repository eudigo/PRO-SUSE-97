Comments

Converts the given date to a string according to the specified format. The converted NULL-terminated date string is stored in buf. 

Refer to the TO_DATE conversion function described in Chapter 3 of the Oracle8 SQL Reference for a description of format and NLS arguments. 

This function returns an error if the buffer is too small, or if the function is passed an invalid format or unknown language. Overflow also causes an error. For example, converting a value of 10 into
format '9' causes an error.
