0.0 BUFFER OVERRUN IN QPOPPER:
------------------------------
Some versions of qpopper are prone to buffer overrun. Remote 
users can exploit this bug and obtain root access. If you are 
using qpopper2.41 or older please upgrade or patch it with new 
versions.

1.0 QUICKNOTES:
---------------
To compile the qpopper, change the directory to where the 
sources of qpopper are located and run the following 
commands. 

	./configure
	make

Running the configure script builds the Makefile for your 
operating system. Using the default settings, the Makefile 
can run correctly for the following operating Systems: 
Solaris, HPUX, IRIX, SCO, SunOS4.x, Linux, BSDI, FreeBSD 
and Digital OSF1.

Running make builds the popper for your Operating system. 
Although there is no required location, many sysadmins prefer 
/usr/local/lib.

Modify your /etc/inetd.conf file to contain the line below. 
You may have to modify it to support your version of the file. 
pop3 stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/lib/popper popper -s

If your OS does not have an inetd.conf file, then it uses 
the config file /etc/servers.  Use the following line:
pop3	tcp	/usr/local/etc/qpopper	qpopper -s

For all OS versions you must modify, your /etc/services file 
needs to include the following line:
pop3         110/tcp                # Post Office

Restart inetd with a kill -HUP inetdpid (some systems can 
use inetd -c).
    
If you have modified these files for AIX, the commands 
displayed below may work for you.  First you need to import 
the new inetd.conf file, and then you need to re-init inetd.  
Use the following commands:
	    inet imp
	    refresh -s inetd

If you are running NIS, please don't forget to update your 
maps.

2.0 RUN-TIME OPTIONS (COMMAND LINE OPTIONS):
--------------------------------------------
The following are command line options you may want to use.

popper [-d] [-k] [-s] [-t trace-file] [-T timeout] [-b bulldir] 


-b bulldir	- This is the location of the bulletin 
               directory.  The command line will override the 
               compiled value if it is defined.   A bulletin 
               database can be used to track the bulletins 
               instead of the users home directory. 
               This feature is enabled with -DBULLDB during 
               compilation. -DBULLDB requires two blank files 
               including the name of BULLDIR/bulldb.pag and 
               the creation of BULLDIR/bulldb.dir.

-d	       - Enables the debug logging if compiled.

-k	       - If compiled with -DKERBEROS, this flag 
               enables Kerberos support only. In qpopper, 
               enter this command at the appropriate kpop port 
               in inetd.

-s	       - This enables statistics logging.  

-t logfile     - If debug and trace files are defined, output 
               from logging goes to the trace file instead of 
               syslog.

-T timeout     - You can change the compiled default for read 
               timeouts. This value causes the qpopper to 
               terminate the connection with the client and 
               move the messages back to the user's maildrop 
               The RFC states that this timeout should be 600 
               seconds (10 minutes). However, ideal settings 
               are between 30 and 120 second.


3.0 APOP:
---------
APOP is an alternate authentication method.  This is a secure
method to authenticate without passing the password in 
cleartext over the wire. Building this support to the server
would require DBM or GDBM libraries to exist on the system. 
GDBM is a GNU's version of dbm which can be obtained from any
of GNU's distribution sites.

To setup APOP - 
 *  Create a user account(for eg:"pop") that would be used for 
   administering the APOP users. 
 *  Choose a location where APOP would place the authentication 
   files (Make sure that would be read/write accessible only to 
   the administering accoung("pop"). Typically "/etc/pop.auth".
 *  Run configure script with the options --enable-apop and
   --with-popuid.

 eg: ./configure --enable-apop=/etc/pop.auth --with-popuid=pop

   The first definition is the location of the authentication 
   files; the second specifies the administering account that 
   will own the authentication database.
 *  Run the make, and this should produce executables "popauth"
   and "popper".
 *  Move the executables to a public location.
 *  Change the owner on popauth to administering account("pop")
   and set SUID.

 eg: chown pop popauth
     chmod u+s popauth

 *  Initialize the authentication database files by running 
   following command :

   popauth -init

 *  New users can be added by root or the administering ("pop")
   user with the following command:

	    popauth -user <user>

   Or removed with the following command:

	    popauth -delete <user>

   Any other user can add themselves or change their password 
   with the following command: 

	    popauth


4.0 BULLETINS:
--------------
Bulletins can be used to send the messages to all POP users.
Bulletins are placed as plain text files in a specified format 
under a directory known to the server.

4.1) To Enable Bulletins :
 *  Choose the directory where the bulletins would reside.
   Typically "/var/spool/bulls". The directory should be 
   entereable with user privileges.
 *  Run the configure script with option --enable-bulletins.

   eg: ./configure --enable-bulletins=/var/spool/bulls

 *  Running make should produce the popper executable.
 *  Use the command line option -b for popper to override the 
   compiled value of bulletin directory.

4.2) Writing Bulletins :
     Bulletins have to be placed as files in the BULLDIR 
    and the directory should be entereable and the files 
    inside readable with user privileges.

     Readable file names can be choosen for bulletins 
    using the number.string form, for example, 
    00001.Bulletin_one, 00002.2hr_Downtime_2-4-95.
    Give each bulletin a unique and an ascending order number.
    The number portion of filename should be 1 + the largest
    bulletin number in directory. [Warning : Recycling the 
    bulletin numbers is not supported yet.]

     Contents in bulletin should be in same format as 
    messages in mail spool. For example : 

    -------------- start message -------------
    From qpop Wed Nov  9 13:31:08 1998
    Date: Wed, 9 Nov 1998 13:31:07 -0800 (PST)
    From: "POP Administrator" <qpopper@qualcomm.com>
    Subject: Example bulletin

    This is an example bulletin to demonstrate the format
    in which bulletins have to be placed.  This message 
    will be appended to mailspool when the user checks 
    his/her mail.

    If you remove this file later on, it wouldn't be seen by
    users who haven't checked their mail since you placed this
    bulletin.

    Try to preserve the rfc822 header format, esecially date
    format. Failing which clients may not parse information 
    in headers correctly. 
    Allow a blank line between headers and message body.
    --------------- end message --------------

     Do not include the --- start message --- and 
    --- end message --- lines to your bulletin.

4.3) How does bulletins work :
    During POP session after the authentication by user, server
    copies the bulletins placed in the BULLDIR in to the users
    message spool. Server would figure out the last bulletin 
    read by user by placing under users home directory ~/.popbull
    the last bulletin number read. Any bulletin in the BULLDIR
    with number greater than the one in ~/.popbull would be copied
    to users message spool.


5.0 SERVER MODE :
-----------------

5.1) To Enable Server mode :
  * Run the configure script with option --enable-servermode.
   and the rest is same.

5.2) When to use server mode : 
    This mode of operation is specifically designed to work with 
   POP accounts only. Use this mode for a better throughput from
   server when there is huge user base to the server. Read all the
   sections about server mode before enabling.

5.3) Bottleneck in normal mode :
    In the default mode server after authentication copies the 
   mail in users message spool to a temporary file(.user.pop).
   Once user terminates the session the undeleted messages are
   moved back to the message spool. When the users download all
   the messages and delete them from the server (Which is commonly
   done by most sites and clients.) on every session, server need
   not have to make a copy of the message spool to temporary file.
   The same is true for users who leave all their mail on server.
   and do occasional mailchecks. For large pop servers, the extra 
   IO processing can be a performance problem. SERVER-MODE is 
   created to improve the performance of the mentioned users.

5.4) Server Mode Operation :
    Enabling SERVER_MODE assumes that the other programs that write
   to the message spool is "Delivery agent". In server mode, the 
   mailspool is locked, scanned, and then unlocked. The qpopper 
   assumes that only new messages will be appended to the mailspool.  
   After retrieving messages, the qpopper checks for any 
   remaining messages (undeleted messages)for status and UID 
   updates. If there are any changes, it updates the mailspool.

5.5) Benefits of Server Mode :
    The benefit of using this mode is that the mailspool is not
   copied to the temporary spool area unless mail is left on 
   the server, and when messages are read and/or deleted.  The 
   NO_STATUS flag causes the qpopper to ignore the Status 
   header and recalculates the UID each time the mailspool is 
   run. When new messages are read, the new UID and Status 
   headers are not updated and no copy of the mailspool is 
   done.  
    
   In server mode, if all messages are deleted, then the 
   mailspool is truncated (unless new messages have arrived).  
   The initial copy is not processed, and IO cycles are saved.  

6.0 SHADOW PASSWORDS / ENHANCED SECURITY SYSTEMS :
--------------------------------------------------

Some OS configurations require different libraries to perform the 
authentication.
For these systems run the configure script with 
  ./configure --enable-specialauth
or
  define AUTH_SPECIAL, the preprocessor macro.

The known systems that Qpopper supports with AUTH_SPECIAL are,
  Linux with Shadow passwords
  Digital Unix with C2 Enabled.
  HP Unix in Trusted Mode.
  SUNOS4.x with Shadow passwords

The systems for which the macro AUTH_SPECIAL is active by default are,
  SCO
  ULTRIX
  SOLARIS


7.0 COMPILE TIME MACROS(for other options):
-------------------------------------------

There are options to consider when doing a build. If you 
want to change any of the default settings, make the 
appropriate changes to the Makefile while reading this 
document. 

7.1) config.h & popper.h - There are some macro definitions 
you may want to change.

  a) MMDF_SEP_CHAR - Default is '\001' (<CTL>-A).  
 A line that starts with this character is 
 considered an MMDF separator.  The rest of the 
 line is copied as the separator regardless of its 
 value.

  b) BULLDIR - Is the compiled value as opposed to 
 the command line option that enables bulletins.
 You can also specify this value in the makefile 
 -DBULLDIR=\"/var/spool/bulls\". This makes
 bulletins the default regardless of the command 
 line options.  The option -DBULLDB uses
 an ndbm or gdbm database for tracking bulletins 
 sent to pop users.  If you use this feature, it 
 will read the old ~user/.popbull file if it 
 exists. -DBULLDB requires two blank files with 
 the name of BULLDIR/bulldb.pag and 
 BULLDIR/bulldb.dir to be created.

  c) NEWBULLCNT - New users receive all bulletins 
 by default. This value reduces the max bulletin 
 value for new qpopper users.

  d) OFF_T - If "off_t" is not typedefed for you, 
 then set this definition to a type that lseek and 
 ftruncate and expect it as an offset parameter.
 UID_T, GID_T, and PID_T are also available for 
 portability.

  e) BLOCK_UID - This value protects mailboxes of 
 all UIDs, at and below, from being accessed via 
 the qpopper.  The default value is 10 meaning 
 that root and other users with UID values of 10 
 and under will not be able to login via the 
 qpopper.

  f) POP_DROP - When qpopper runs, it moves your 
 mailspool to a temporary location (.user.pop).  The 
 default location is in the mail spool directory.  
 /tmp is an alternative but is considered to be a 
 security risk. A system reboot usually clears the 
 temporary .user.pop files. For performance reasons, a 
 sysadmin who has 1000+ users can create a separate 
 spool directory for qpopper files; /usr/spool/poptemp 
 is preferable. Permissions should be the same as your 
 mailspool with the same owner and group. Edit the value
 of POP_DROP in config.h. 
 For Eg: #define POP_DROP "/usr/spool/poptemp/.%s.pop"

7.2) Makefile - The makefile for your OS is setup for 
the most common defaults. Below are some values you 
may want to modify.
These precompiler macros are to be placed in Makefile. 
Append these defines to DEFS in Makefile. For eg to 
enable Kerberos modify DEFS in Makefile to 
  DEFS   =  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DKERBEROS
To enable Kerberos and Verbose Debugging
  DEFS   =  -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -DKERBEROS -DDEBUG

  a) KERBEROS - Define this value if you want to 
 add Kerberos IV support to the server.  Update 
 the makefile so you can load the appropriate 
 libraries(-lkrb).  This option works only if you 
 have Kerberos headers and libraries installed.  
 You can also define KUSEROK if you want to use 
 the kuserok()function.

  b1) AUTHFILE - Define this value to reference the 
 file which allows only users listed in the file 
 to have qpopper access.  
 Ex: -DAUTHFILE=\"/etc/authfile\"
 The format is a list of user id's, one per line.

  b2) NONAUTHFILE - Define this value to reference 
 the file which excludes listed users.
 Ex: -DAUTHFILE=\"/etc/nonauthfile\"
 The format is a list of user id's, one per line.

  c) AUTH_SPECIAL - Define this value if your system 
 supports special authorization mechanisms like 
 shadow passwords or special crypt programs. 
 Qpopper's makefiles support this feature. 
 SunOS4.x does not support this by default, since 
 it requires the code to be loaded which is not 
 done by default. If you support shadow passwords 
 on SunOS4.x, then define SUNOS4 and AUTH_SPECIAL in the 
 Makefile. You may have to port a pop_pass routine 
 for your OS before enabling this feature.

  d) RPOP - This feature allows the pop client to 
 use the hosts.equiv and .rhosts files for 
 system/user validation.  This feature is not 
 recommended since it can spoof both a PC or Mac 
 system.

  e) SECURENISPLUS - Add this definition if you are 
 running secure NIS+; that is, when the qpopper 
 server cannot access a user’s encrypted password.

  f) DEBUG - Verbose logging requires the -d 
 commandline argument to enable.  Enable this only 
 if you are having problems figuring out why the 
 qpopper is not working.  Log files on busy 
 systems expand quickly.
	    
  g) SETPROCTITLE - This definition controls 
 whether setproctitle()should be used to display 
 user, host, and status in the process title.  
 Your OS must support this feature.

  h) KEEP_TEMP_DROP - Keep the .user.pop file.  It 
 can determine the last time a user has accessed 
 his/her mail.

  i) BIND43 - BSD 4.3 is a domain name service.

  j) SYSLOG42 - The QUALCOMM qpopper defaults to 
 BSD 4.3 syslog.

  k) HOMEDIRMAIL - Define this value if mail is 
 spooled into the user's home directory. Check the
 macro and the sprintf statement in pop_dropcopy.c 
 ensuring that it is correct for your system.

  l) APOP=\"/etc/pop.auth\" - This value is the 
 location of the authorization database.  Users 
 found in this DB may not use user/pass 
 authentication if they are found in the apop 
 database.

  m) POPUID=\"pop\" - This value is the username of 
 the owner of the apop database.

  n) GNUPASS - This definition specifies the use of 
 the (modified) GNU getpass routine which allows 
 longer than 8 character passwords to be entered 
 when using popauth. There is also a definition 
 within popauth (NO_GETLINE) if you
 compile this code, and it complains of not having 
 a getline routine.

  o) CONTENT_LENGTH - If your MTA (Mail Delivery
 Agent) inserts a Content-Length header into the 
 message, you must define this option.

  p) SERVER_MODE - See SERVER MODE section for 
 details.

  q) NO_STATUS - Do not update the status Header of 
 the message and do not store the UID in the 
 message header.

  r) NOUPDATEONABORT - By default, the qpopper  
 enters the update state on abort. This flag 
 causes the qpopper to ignore any changes 
 (deletions) to occur if a qpopper session is 
 aborted.

  s) HASH_SPOOL=(1|2) - Mail is deposited into the 
 mailspools by either 
   (1) hashing the first 4 characters or 
   (2) by using mailspools in directories as in the 
  following:  /<1st letter>/<2nd letter>/file.

  t) BULLDB - Use a central database located in the 
 bulletin directory instead of a user’s home 
 directory.  This feature uses the user’s .popbull 
 file the first time for backwards compatibility.  
 BULLDBDIR can be defined in the makefile if an 
 alternate location for the bulletin database is 
 desired.

  u) CHECK_SHELL - Enable this compile time feature 
 to lock out users via the shell value.  A user 
 shell of /QPOPPER/ANY/SHELL allows the user 
 access but blocks other programs that check 
 shells.
		
  v) GDBM - This value uses the GNU's GDBM library 
 instead of NDBM.




NOTES:

The qpopper uses /etc/passwd to validate the userid for any user 
in any mode (user/pass, kerberos, apop, authuser, nonauthuser).  
The reason being that the mail spool file must be owned by 
someone, and ownership relationships live in /etc/passwd.  So, a 
user name must exist in both the passwd file as well as any of 
the other files associated with other authentication methods.

SCO - Some versions of SCO use the crypt_d library, others 
the crypt_i library.  This distribution assumes crypt_d. SCO
	requires loading the Standard and TCP/IP development 
environments to get the sockets and crypt libraries.

IRIX - The default spool directory is /usr/mail; some 
systems use /usr/spool/mail.

FreeBSD - This requires the crypt library for password 
comparisons. Check the FreeBSD.crypt file in the doc 
directory for the appropriate locations.

OSF/1 - If you are not using enhanced security (shadow 
passwords), then turn off the AUTH define. Otherwise, you 
receive a link error stating that set_auth_parameters() is 
not defined.

A/UX - A/UX does not support the sticky bit, so the default 
dir is /tmp.  If you want to support shadow passwords, you 
need to add the -DAUTH define into make.aux.  A shadow 
passwd library is also required.  You can find one on
jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.  A/UX requires gcc and libUTIL.a,
also available on jagubox to build this version of qpopper.

ISC - APOP does not work because the port was installed on a 
system without dbm.  If you want to use apop, then get a 
working dbm library, change the link line, and add the APOP 
definitions.

SUNOS - Some systems don't seem to have strerr defined in 
the default location.  You may need to use the alternate 
CFLAGS to compile correctly.

NCR - You may need to increase STRTHRESH, for example, a 600 
user system needs to increase from 0x200000 to 0x600000.

Next - You should probably use NetInfo Manager available 
under Next Admin to change your services file.

Bulletins - The From line must be complete with address and 
date. If the qpopper can use full From lines, then a simple 
"From" line causes the message to get concatenated to the 
previous message.

DEBUGGING:
Telnet to the qpopper port "telnet <qpopper host> pop3." 
INETD is not servicing the POP port if you receive one of 
the following error messages:

	1. "connect: Connection refused"

	2. "connect: Connection closed"
	    
If you receive message 1, check your services file and make 
sure the port name "POP3" is exactly the same as the one in 
inetd.conf.  Also, it can indicate that you have not reset 
inetd (kill -HUP <inetd PID>)(some systems can use inetd -
c). 

If you receive message 2, this indicates that inetd has the 
correct port assigned to the qpopper, but that either 
program cannot be located, or it is failing on startup.  If 
you are compiling with a listed OS, chances are the POP 
program is not named correctly in the /etc/inetd.conf file.  
Otherwise, add the -d flag and check your log messages for 
the source of the problem.

If you have correctly installed the qpopper as far as inetd 
is concerned, you will see the following line, and the 
startup banner is displayed:

+OK QPOP (version 2.53) at <system> starting. <13625.811191280@system>

Now, you need to run two commands to give yourself 
authorization to run qpopper. Make sure you have a message 
or two queued so you can ensure that the qpopper is pointing 
at the correct mail spool file.  Be aware that the password 
is echoed back: 

  	user <your user name here>
    	+OK Password required for <your user name users>
    	pass <your password>
    	+OK mark has 2 message(s) (4123 octets).

If you have the authority and if you have two messages, you 
can enter QUIT to exit.  LIST and UIDL are two commands to 
list messages by size and ID. At this point, Eudora or any 
other pop client should not have any problems communicating 
with your qpopper.

If you get the following message: Unable to process From 
lines (envelops), change recognition modes.

This indicates that your mailbox is corrupted; that is, the 
first line which includes the From header or MMDF separator 
is not recognizable. Or there may be a From line displayed 
that has never appeared before.  Edit the mail spool file 
and send the first line.  If the first line is blank, then 
remove it until you reach the From line.

If an error message displays indicating that your password 
is incorrect, you might be using a shadow password, and you 
may need to use the -DAUTH definition. Or, you might be 
using a UID less than 11 (default) which is automatically 
blocked from access.
